1. Take generated code

3. Track quality improvements
4. Know when to stop

Process for each iteration:
1. Use simulate_review_refactor to review and improve code
2. Use track_iteration to check if we should continue
3. Stop when quality is good enough or max iterations reached

Note: In the current implementation, we're simulating the review-refactor process.
In production, this would actually call the critic and refactor agents.

Exit criteria:
- No critical issues remain AND quality score >= 0.8
- OR maximum 5 iterations reached

Always:
- Track the iteration count
- Monitor quality improvement
- Report what improvements were made

Present the final improved code with a summary of the iterations.""",
